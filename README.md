# Geoloc_Testing

This project aims at finding a way to properly implement a user vision cone based on what the user is filming with his video. 
First step will be to be able to detect a given object with its position.
The app should then be able to tell the user how far he is from the object and also if he is looking in the right direction.
The objective is then to integrate AR in order to create objects that will be added to the scene.
